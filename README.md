### Notes:

# React Router Dom
- React-router-dom <Link> binds urls to react components removing the need for <a> tags which requires page reloads
- All children components inside <Router> can access routing info
- Routing context must wrap everything that needs navigation (eg. <Navbar> inside App())

# React
- React is basically OOP with composition > inheritance
